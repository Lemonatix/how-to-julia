# How-to-Julia

This repository is a course created to help learn Julia, a high-level, high-performance programming language for technical computing.
It also hosts plots, mainly for mathematics and physics.

## Introduction

Welcome to the "How-to-Julia" course! This course is designed to help you learn the Julia programming language from scratch. Whether you are a beginner or have some experience in programming, this course will provide you with the knowledge and skills needed to effectively use Julia.

Also there is a dedicated folder for mathematics, as julia is a superb tool to easily visualise characteristics in math (i.e. functions $\mathbb{R}^n$).

## Getting Started

To get started with the course, you will need to have Julia installed on your system. You can download and install Julia from the official website [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
As some files are hosted that are from the math module MA0010 (2025) at TUM, Pluto is a necessary install as well. To install Pluto, use the following commands
```julia
import Pkg; Pkg.add("Pluto")
```
and to open Pluto use 
```julia
import Pluto; Pluto.run()
```
leading Pluto to open in the browser.
